title: Getting involved
description: Join ONM's collaborative community on Discord. Contribute open source code, write blog posts, and boost visibility for your projects in neuromorphic computing.

The easiest way to get in touch is probably through [Discord](https://discord.gg/C9bzWgNmqk), where we discuss research topics, job opportunities, open hardware, spiking neural network training and much more. We'd be delighted to have you join! 
If you feel like contributing to ONM but you're not exactly sure how, here are some ideas to get you started:

* Link an interesting open source repository to our [collection](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/open-neuromorphic) so that others can find it too! This can be a framework / package that deals with neuromorphic things or a neat implementation for example! ONM is meant as a platform to showcase your code and others'!
* Write a blog post together with the community. If you think you learned something useful that you'd like to share with the community, you can simply post your draft on our Discord to ask for some feedback. In case you then want to publish it on our website, take a look at the structure of [existing posts](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/open-neuromorphic.github.io/tree/main/content/post) and open a PR for a new one. Think about it as a mini paper!
* Why not host your code in the ONM organisation directly? It'll boost visibility and you can get instant help/feedback from community members. You can also migrate an existing repository if you wish to do so.
